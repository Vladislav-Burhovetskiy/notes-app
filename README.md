# Notes app | React [DEMOLINK](https://vladislav-burhovetskiy.github.io/notes-app/)
I saved 2 options:
- localStorage;
- firebase;

If you want to use firebase:
- you must change your own data in firebase.js file;
- uncoment all code for firebase;
- connect App.jsx with firebase code;

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

Happy Coding!
